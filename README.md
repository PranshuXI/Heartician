## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

Our ML model was trained to classify ECG patterns into healthy or potentially diseased states.

**Classification Report:**
```

```
           precision    recall  f1-score   support

       0       0.87      0.84      0.86        77
       1       0.89      0.91      0.90       107
```

```

- **Class 0** → Normal Heart Activity  
- **Class 1** → Signs of Potential Heart Disease  

📈 **Performance:** High precision and recall, showing reliable detection capability for both classes.
## 🌟 Our Vision

We built **Heartician** as students, but we believe it has the potential to:
- Enable **affordable healthcare diagnostics** anywhere in the world.
- Assist in **early detection** and preventive care.
- Integrate with cloud-based medical systems for **remote patient monitoring**.
